I am SowmithK, a 2nd year PhD student in High-Performance Automated
Reasoning([HARP](harp-lab.com)) Lab under [Thomas
Gilray](https://thomas.gilray.org/). Working on accelerating logical reasoning
using GPUs. Current project involves building a GPU execution engine for
Datalog, building on previous work
([Sun25Opt](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3669940.3707274),
[Sun25Col](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/33665),
[Shovon23](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc23/presentation/shovon)) from
the lab, to serve as GPU backend for Slog
([Gilray25](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/3712221.3712232)).

Particularly interested in building High Performance libraries in the realm of graphs
and databases, building a datalog engine satisfies all three of these curiosities.

I am also working with [Akash](https://akashgrao.github.io/) on his distributed
iterative matmul to support linear recursive queries with no communication.
This work is letting us focus on Linear Algebra and Relational Algebra, and the
connection between them.

Always looking to chat with people, who have interests in high performance
applications, databases or graphs. Please feel to reach out to my email.

I am looking for an internship this summer(26), if you have something that
matches my interests, please reach out, I'd be excited to chat.
