    abstract = {Datalog is a popular logic programming language for deductive
                reasoning tasks in a wide array of applications, including
                business analytics, program analysis, and ontological reasoning.
                However, Datalog's restriction to flat facts over atomic
                constants leads to challenges in working with tree-structured
                data, such as derivation trees or abstract syntax trees. To
                ameliorate Datalog's restrictions, popular extensions of Datalog
                support features such as existential quantification in rule heads
                (Datalog*, Datalog∃) or algebraic data types (Souffl\'{e}).
                Unfortunately, these are imperfect solutions for reasoning over
                structured and recursive data types, with general existentials
                leading to complex implementations requiring unification, and
                ADTs unable to trigger rule evaluation and failing to support
                efficient indexing.We present DL∃!, a Datalog with first-class
                facts, wherein every fact is identified with a Skolem term unique
                to the fact. We show that this restriction offers an attractive
                price point for Datalogbased reasoning over tree-shaped data,
                demonstrating its application to databases, artificial
                intelligence, and programming languages. We implemented DL∃! as a
                system Slog, which leverages the uniqueness restriction of DL∃!
                to enable a communication-avoiding, massively-parallel
                implementation built on MPI. We show that Slog outperforms
                leading systems (Nemo, Vlog, RDFox, and Souffl\'{e}) on a variety
                of benchmarks, with the potential to scale to thousands of
                threads.},
