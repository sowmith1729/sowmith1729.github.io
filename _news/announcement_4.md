Completed my qualifying examination(first step towards PhD), surveyed optimal joins, and suitability
for acceleration using GPUs. Focused on Acyclic Optimal Joins using [Diamond
Hardened
Joins](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/volumes/17/paper/Robust%20Join%20Processing%20with%20Diamond%20Hardened%20Joins),
and proposed ideas to simplify implementing WCOJ on GPU compared to SOTA.
