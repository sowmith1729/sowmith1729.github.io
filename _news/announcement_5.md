Participated in Network for Science workshop hosted by Berkeley Labs to present
[Akash's](https://akashgrao.github.io/) poster on iterative parallel matrix
exponentiation. Got to chat with [Ariful Azad](https://arifulazad.github.io/)
about [CombBLAS](https://github.com/PASSIONLab/CombBLAS). And see many other
exciting works in the realm of graphs.
